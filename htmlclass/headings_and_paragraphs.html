    <h1>HTML Headings</h1>

    <p>
        Headings are very important in HTML and website design. Search engines use the headings to 
        index the structure and content of your web pages. <br><br>

        Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document 
        structure. <br><br>

        Headings are defined by the <b>h1 to h6 tags</b>.

        <pre>
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading Level One&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Heading Level Two&lt;/h2&gt;
            ...
        </pre>

        The most important headings are defined by the <b>h1</b> tag down to the <b>h6</b> tag. <br><br><br>

    <h1>HTML Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>
        In HTML, paragraphs are created using the <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> tag. A paragraph typically contains a
        few sentences or a short piece of text that makes sense on its own. It can be used as 
        a follow-up content to the heading or to explain it just as it is in your textbooks. <br><br>

        The <b>&lt;hr&gt;</b>  tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often 
        displayed as a horizontal rule. It is an empty tag as it has no closing tag<br><br>

        The <b>&lt;br&gt;</b>  tag defines a line break. You can use it to start a new line 
        without starting a new paragraph. <br><br><br>
