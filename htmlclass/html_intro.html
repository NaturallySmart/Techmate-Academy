    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language. It is the standard markup language for
        creating a website. HTML is to a website what a foundation is to a building. It determines
        the structure of the website (i.e how it will look like) as well as the content of the 
        website such as text, images, videos and Audio. <br><br>

        <b>HTML Syntax</b> is basically how you arrange your HTML elements and tags.
