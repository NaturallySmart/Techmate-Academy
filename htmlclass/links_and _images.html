    <h1>Links and Images</h1>

    <h2>HTML HYPERLINKS</h2>

    <P>
        Hyperlinks are used to connect web pages together by linking text on one page with the 
        same or different text on another webpage. With links in HTML you can link your webpage
        to other website such as Google, Wikipedia, Facebook and the likes. You also use links
        to link the different pages of your website together. So when you click on the links,
        it will take you to that specific page. Here is the Syntax:

        <pre>
            &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>

       <b>&lt;a&gt;:</b>  This defines an <i>anchor tag.</i> <br>

       <b>href:</b> The href attribute indicates the link's destination. This is not
       visible to the reader. <br>

       The <b>Text</b> is the part visible to the user. When the user clicks on this text,
       he or she is directed to the linked page. <br>

       <b>&lt;/a&gt;:</b> This is the closing of the anchor tag. <br><br>

       Here is an example of a link that leads to Google. <br><br>

       <img src="images/links.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br><br>


       <a href="https://www.google.com">Click Here</a> <br><br>

       Usually a link turns <b>blue</b> when the cursor is placed on it. However, this 
       can be changed with CSS as you will learn later. <br><br>

       By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

       <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
       <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
       <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Links - The target Attribute</h2>

    <p>
        By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
        To change this, you must specify another target for the link. <br><br>

        The <b>target</b> attribute specifies where to open the linked document. <br>
        The <b>target</b> attribute can have one of the following values: <br><br>

       <li> <b>_self</b> - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked</li>
       <li><b>_blank</b> - Opens the document in a new window or tab</li>
       <li><b>_parent</b> - Opens the document in the parent frame</li>
       <li><b>_top</b> - Opens the document in the full body of the window</li>

       Now let's use the <b>_blank</b> attribute to direct our previous link to open in a 
       new window. <br><br>

       <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Click Here</a> <br><br>

       In the above link, what was added to the previous code is: <b>target="_blank"</b>
       which will help direct the link to open in a new tab or window.
    </p>

    <h2>Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs</h2>
    <p>
        An absolute URL contains all parts of a web address (protocol, domain name, path).
        On the other hand, a relative URL does not contain the protocol and domain name.
        It only includes the path information. <br><br>
        For instance, if we were using an image from a website called "example.com",
        the absolute URL would look like this: <br><br>

        <pre>       http://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg</pre>

        While the relative URL would simply be: <br><br>

        <pre>       /path/to/image.jpg</pre>

        The relative URL can be used to link a page in the html folder on the current 
        webpage
    </p>

    <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

    <p>
        The link below will take us to the <b>HTML Course Outline Page</b> of this website. <br> <br>

        <img src="images/link2.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br><br>

        <a href="html_outline.html">Go to Course Outline</a>

    </p>

    <h3><i>Example 2</i></h3>
    <p>
        Let's say we want to include an image from Google. We could do so by using their
        absolute URL: <br><br>

        <img src="images/link3.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br><br>

        <img src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.png"/> <br><br>

        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/logo.png"/> <br><br>

        Links can be used for images, email, buttons, navigation bar, list e.t.c
