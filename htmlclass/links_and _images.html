    <h2>HTML HYPERLINKS</h2>

    <P>
        Hyperlinks are used to connect web pages together by linking text on one page with the 
        same or different text on another webpage. With links in HTML you can link your webpage
        to other website such as Google, Wikipedia, Facebook and the likes. You also use links
        to link the different pages of your website together. So when you click on the links,
        it will take you to that specific page. Here is the Syntax:

        <pre>
            &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>

       <b>&lt;a&gt;:</b>  This defines an <i>anchor tag.</i> <br>

       <b>href:</b> The href attribute indicates the link's destination. This is not
       visible to the reader. <br>

       The <b>Text</b> is the part visible to the user. When the user clicks on this text,
       he or she is directed to the linked page. <br>

       <b>&lt;/a&gt;:</b> This is the closing of the anchor tag. <br><br>

       Here is an example of a link that leads to Google. <br><br>

       <img src="images/links.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br><br>


       <a href="https://www.google.com">Click Here</a> <br><br>

       Usually a link turns <b>blue</b> when the cursor is placed on it. However, this 
       can be changed with CSS as you will learn later. <br><br>

       By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

       <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
       <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
       <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
    </p>
