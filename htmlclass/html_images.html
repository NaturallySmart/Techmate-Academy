        <h1>Images in HTML</h1>

        <p>
            Images are a powerful tool to enhance the visual appeal of your web page. 
            They can be used to display objects or people, showcase products and services, 
            provide information about your business, and much more!  <br><br>
            In this lesson, we will learn how to use images effectively within our HTML documents. <br><br>

            To include an image in your HTML document, you need to use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. 
            The syntax for using an image is as follows: <br><br>

            <pre>
                &lt;img src=&quot;image_path&quot;&gt;
            </pre>
