        <h1>Images in HTML</h1>

        <p>
            Images are a powerful tool to enhance the visual appeal of your web page. 
            They can be used to display objects or people, showcase products and services, 
            provide information about your business, and much more!  <br><br>
            In this lesson, we will learn how to use images effectively within our HTML documents. <br><br>

            To include an image in your HTML document, you need to use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. 
            The syntax for using an image is as follows: <br><br>

            <pre>
                &lt;img src=&quot;image_path&quot;&gt;
            </pre>

            The <b>img</b> tag is an empty tag as it does not require closing.

            <h2>Image Alts</h2>

            The <b>alt</b> attribute is also very important to add to your image, so that 
            if for any reason the browser is not able to display the selected image, it 
            will display the text in the <b>alt</b> attribute so the user can know the
            type of image that was suppose to display. <br><br>

            See an example below:
            <pre>
                &lt;img src=&quot;bigcat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of a cat&quot;&gt;
            </pre>

            <h3>Importance of the Alt Attribute</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
                <li>
                    If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally 
                    intended for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is made 
                   possible by the description you provide in the <b>alt</b> attribute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. 
                    When you include the <b>alt</b> attribute, the screen reading software can read the image’s 
                    description out loud to the visually impaired user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>alt</b> attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), 
                    because search engines cannot “see” the images on websites as they crawl the 
                    internet. Having descriptive <b>alt</b> attributes can improve the ranking of 
                    your site.
                </li>

                If the image on the web page is not one that conveys any meaningful information to
                a user (visually impaired or otherwise), the alt attribute should be left empty. <br><br>

                <b>Now let's add an image to this html file</b> <br><br>

                <img src="images/imagecode.PNG" alt="code for adding image"> <br><br>

                <img src="images/imgdesign/lady-img.jpg" alt="Picture of a lady"> <br><br>


                It's possible that the image added is too big and as such you want to set a width 
                and height properties for it. <br><br>

                <b>See an example below:</b> <br><br>

                  <img src="images/imagecode2.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br><br>

                  <b>Big Image</b> <br><br>

                <img src="images/imgdesign/happy customers.jpg" alt="Happy customer and driver"> <br><br>

                You will see that the above image is too big for our webpage. Now let's reduce it. <br><br>

                <img src="images/imagecode3.PNG" alt="code sample">  <br><br>

                <b>Reduced Image Output</b> <br><br>
                
                <img src="images/imgdesign/happy customers.jpg" alt="Happy customer and driver" 
                width="350px" height="300px"> <br><br>

            </p>
