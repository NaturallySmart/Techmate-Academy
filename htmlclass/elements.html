    <h1>What is an HTML Element?</h1>

    <p>
        An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: <br><br>

        <b>&lt;tagname&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;</b> <br><br>

        For example, the paragraph above was created with this code: <br>

        <pre>
            &lt;p&gt;
                An HTML element is defined by a start tag,
                some content, and an end tag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>

        HTML contains many elements. While some elements has content, others are empty. For instance
        the <b>p</b> tag has n opening and closing tag and contains element within it. same things as 
        the <b>h</b> tags. Other tags such as the <b>br</b> tag, <b>b</b> tag etc are empty tags as 
        they have no elements within them.
