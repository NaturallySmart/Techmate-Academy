    <h1>Variables</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Variables</strong> in Javascript are used to store and manipulate data in a dynamic way. They 
        do this by using a label to represent the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the data types
        which we ave learnt before can be stored in a variable. We create or declare a variable by using the 
        key word <b>var</b>. <br> <br>

        <b>Syntax:</b> <br>
        <i>var myName;</i> <br>
        In this example, "myName" is the name of our variable and it has been declared with the keyword var. 
        <br> <br>

        creates a variable called myName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can 
        be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number. <br><br>

        Variables can also be created using the <b>let</b> and the <b>const</b> keywords.            
    </p>

    <h2>Creating a Variable using <i>var</i></h2>

    <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

    <img src="image/variables/variables.PNG" alt=""> <br>

    <p id="example1"></p>

    <script>
        // Create a variable called 'myCar'
        var myCar = 'Audi';

       document.getElementById('example1').innerHTML = myCar;

        // Will output Audi        
        // document.getElementById('example1').innerHTML = `The name of my car is ${myCar}`;
    </script>

    <p>In the above example:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>var,</b> is the short form of variable used to create or declare a new variable </li>
        <li>
            <b>myCar,</b> is the variableâ€™s name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in 
            JavaScript called camel casing. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is 
            lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. 
            (e.g. camelCaseEverything).
        </li>
        <li><b>'=',</b> assigns the value 'Audi' to the variable.</li>
        <li><b>Audi,</b> is the value assigned to the variable</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> variables are case sensitive. For instance the variable <b><i>myCar</i></b> is not same
        with <b><i>mycar</i></b>.
    </p> <br><br>
