    <h1>Variables</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Variables</strong> in Javascript are used to store and manipulate data in a dynamic way. They 
        do this by using a label to represent the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the data types
        which we ave learnt before can be stored in a variable. We create or declare a variable by using the 
        key word <b>var</b>. <br> <br>

        <b>Syntax:</b> <br>
        <i>var myName;</i> <br>
        In this example, "myName" is the name of our variable and it has been declared with the keyword var. 
        <br> <br>

        creates a variable called myName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can 
        be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number. <br><br>

        Variables can also be created using the <b>let</b> and the <b>const</b> keywords.
