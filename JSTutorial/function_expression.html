    <h1>Function Expressions</h1>

    <p>
        Another way to define a function is to use a <b><i>function expression</i></b>. To define a function 
        inside an expression, we can use the <i>function</i> keyword. In a function expression, the function 
        name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an anonymous function. A function expression 
        is often stored in a variable in order to refer to it. <br><br>

        To declare a function expression:

        <ol>
            <li>
                Declare a variable to make the variable’s name be the name, or identifier, of your function.
                Since the release of ES6, it is common practice to use const as the keyword to declare the 
                variable that will hold our function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assign as that variable’s value an anonymous function created by using the function keyword 
                followed by a set of parentheses with possible parameters. Then a set of curly braces that 
                contain the function body.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
