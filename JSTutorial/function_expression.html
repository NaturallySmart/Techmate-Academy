    <h1>Function Expressions</h1>

    <p>
        Another way to define a function is to use a <b><i>function expression</i></b>. To define a function 
        inside an expression, we can use the <i>function</i> keyword. In a function expression, the function 
        name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an anonymous function. A function expression 
        is often stored in a variable in order to refer to it. <br><br>

        To declare a function expression:

        <ol>
            <li>
                Declare a variable to make the variable’s name be the name, or identifier, of your function.
                Since the release of ES6, it is common practice to use const as the keyword to declare the 
                variable that will hold our function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assign as that variable’s value an anonymous function created by using the function keyword 
                followed by a set of parentheses with possible parameters. Then a set of curly braces that 
                contain the function body.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <b>Syntax:</b>
        <pre>
            const myFunc = function (param1, param2) {
                // Function Body...
            };
        </pre>

        To invoke a function expression, write the name of the variable in which the function is stored 
        followed by parentheses enclosing any arguments being passed into the function.
        <br><br>
        Example:
        <pre>
            let result = myFunc(arg1, arg2);  // myFunc is the variable name
        </pre>

        Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted so they cannot be called before 
        they are defined.
    </p>

    <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>

    <p>
        Let's say you watch football every saturday, let's create a function expression to check the day of
        the week so we can know if we are watching football today.
    </p>

    <p id="example1"></p>

    <img src="image/functions/function7.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br>

    <script>
        const watchFootball = function(day) { // variable created and assigned an anonymous function of day
            if (day === 'Saturday') {
                return true;  // a conditional statement to return true if the day is Saturday
            } else {
                return false; // a conditional statement to return false if the day is not Saturday
            }

            watchFootball('Monday'); //assigns a day to the variable
        }

        document.getElementById('example1').innerHTML =  watchFootball('Monday');
    </script>

<h1>Arrow Functions</h1>
<p>
    Arrow functions or short-hand syntax for JavaScript functions were introduced with ECMAScript 6.
    They have shorter syntax compared to regular functions and uses the special <b>“fat arrow” () => notation.</b>
    <br><br>

    Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. 
    Instead, you first include the parameters inside the ( ) and then add an arrow => that points to the 
    function body surrounded in { } like the sample below: <br><br>
</p>

<img src="image/functions/arrowfunction.PNG" alt="code sample"> <br>

<script>
    const landSize = (width, lenght) => {
        let area = width * lenght;
        return area;
    };
</script>

<p>
    It is important to be familiar with the multiple ways of writing functions because you will come 
    across each of these when reading other JavaScript code.
