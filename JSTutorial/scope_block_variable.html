            <h1>Block Scope</h1>

            <p>
                When a variable is defined inside a block, it is only accessible to the code within the 
                curly braces {}. We say that variable has block scope because it is only accessible to 
                the lines of code within that block. <br><br>
        
                Variables that are declared with block scope are known as local variables because they 
                are only available to the code that is part of the same block. <br><br>
        
                Block scope works like this:
        
                <pre>
                    const logShirtColor = () => {
                        let color = 'blue'; 
                        console.log(color); // Prints "blue"
                    };
        
                    logShirtColor(); // Prints "blue"
        
                    console.log(color); // throws a ReferenceError
                </pre>
