    <h3>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <h1>String Properties</h1>

    <P>
        All datatypes have access to specific properties that when appended to it, a result is achieved. For instance
        <b>Strings</b> have the <b>Length</b> property that stores the number of characters in that string. <br>
        You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name.

        The <b>. Operator</b> is used to add the string to the property. <br>
        <b>See Code Sample Below</b>
