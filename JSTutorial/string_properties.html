    <h3>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <h1>String Properties</h1>

    <P>
        All datatypes have access to specific properties that when appended to it, a result is achieved. For instance
        <b>Strings</b> have the <b>Length</b> property that stores the number of characters in that string. <br>
        You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name.

        The <b>. Operator</b> is used to add the string to the property. <br>
        <b>See Code Sample Below</b>
    </P>

        console.log('Techmate'.length);
        // Will output 8
    </script>

    <h2>Javascript Methods</h2>

    <p>
        In JavaScript methods are object properties containing a function definition. Within the function
        definition, this can be used to refer to the containing object as long as the function is defined 
        within the object. <br><br>

        <i>
            Note: If a function is assigned to a property later, any reference to this will reflect the 
            context of the new function. Also, if the object’s function is assigned to a variable and executed
            via the variable, this will reflect the variable’s execution context.
