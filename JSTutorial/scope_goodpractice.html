    <h1>Practice Good Scoping</h1>

    <p>
        In programming, practicing good scoping is a key concept to avoid variable conflicts and unexpected 
        behavior in your code. <br><br>

        This will greatly improve your code in several ways:

        <li>
            It will make your code more legible since the blocks will organize your code into discrete sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            It makes your code more understandable since it clarifies which variables are associated with 
            different parts of the program rather than having to keep track of them line after line!
        </li>
        <li>
            Itâ€™s easier to maintain your code, since your code will be modular.
        </li>
        <li>
            It will save memory in your code because it will cease to exist after the block finishes running.
        </li>
        <li>
            It helps you keep track of the variables that are available within each function or block of code.
        </li>
