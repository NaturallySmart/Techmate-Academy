        <h1>Loops</h1>

        <p>
            In programming, it is important that we often write codes that needs to run
            and output a different result until a specific condition is met. <br><br>

            Take for instance, you are hungry (start point), then you have to eat, and 
            once you are full (stop condition), you stop eating, if not, you continue 
            eating till your stomach can't hold any more food. This is called a loop. <br><br>

            A loop is a programming tool that repeats a set of instructions until a specified 
            condition, called a stopping condition is reached. As a programmer, you’ll find 
            that you rely on loops all the time! You’ll hear the generic term iterate when 
            referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”. <br> <br>

            When we need to reuse a task in our code, we often bundle that action in a function. 
            Similarly, when we see that a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write 
            a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, 
            manageable programs.
        </p>

        <h1>Repeating Tasks Manually</h1>

        <p>
            Before we go into <b>Lopps</b>proper, let's look at why loops is very important and should be
            appreciated. Without loops, repeating a task by typing all the codes for the task each time 
            will be very cumbersome.

            <b>See example below</b>
        </p>

        <script>
            const visitCity = ['London', 'Paris', 'Dubai'];

            console.log(visitCity[0]);
            console.log(visitCity[1]);
            console.log(visitCity[2]);
        </script>
