    <h1>Updating Elements In an Array</h1>

    <p>
        We have learnt how we can access an element in an array using it's index.
        We can also update an element in an array using the index of that element. <br><br>

        Now let's say you have a list of groceries that you need to purchase in an array,
        and after a while, you decided to change one of the items to another one, how do 
        you do that in array? Letâ€™s see that.

        <pre>
            const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "Mango"];
                //let's say you want to replace banana with grapes
                    fruits[1] = "grapes";
                        console.log(fruits);
            outputs: // ["apple", "grapes", "orange", "Mango"]
        </pre>

        In the above example, we have an array <b>fruits</b> which contains four elements.
        We decided to change banana to grapes by changing the element in index 1 to grapes.
