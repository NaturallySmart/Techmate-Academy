    <h1>Scope</h1>

    <p>
        <b>Scope</b> is a very important idea in programming. It determines the accessibility (visibility)
        of <b>variables</b>. <br><br>

        JavaScript has three types of scope which are:
        <ul>
            <li>Global Scope</li>
            <li>Block Scope</li>
            <li>Function Scope</li>       
        </ul>

        You can think of Scope like the view of the night sky from your window. No matter where you are,
        when you look out of your window, you will see the stars which means the stars can be accessed
        globally (Global Scope). However, if there is a river in ypur city, you can only see that river
        in that city (Block Scope), but if you travel away from your city, that river will no longer be visible to you
        but the stars will still be visible at night no matter where you are. <br><br>
