        <h1>Global Scope</h1>

        <p>
            In <b><i>global scope</i></b>, variables are declared outside of blocks. These variables are called 
            global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any 
            code in the program, including code in blocks. <br><br>
    
            Let’s take a look at an example of global scope:
    
            <pre>
                const color = 'blue';
                const returnSkyColor = () => {
                    return color; // blue 
                    };
                console.log(returnSkyColor); // blue
            </pre>
    
            In the above code illustration, you will notice that even though the <b>color</b> variable
            is defined outside of the block, it can still be accessed within the function block because
            it has been declared globally. In turn, color can be accessed within the returnSkyColor function block.
            <br><br>
