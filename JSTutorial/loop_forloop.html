        <h1>The For Loop</h1>

        <p>
            Instead of writing out the same code over and over, loops allow us to tell computers 
            to repeat a given block of code on its own. One way to give computers these instructions 
            is with a <b>for loop</b>. <br><br>

            The typical for loop includes an <b>iterator variable</b> that usually appears in all three 
            expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, 
            and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, 
            but itâ€™s best practice to use a descriptive variable name. <br><br>

            A <b>for loop</b> contains three expressions separated by a semi-colon (;) inside the parentheses:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Initialization - This expression sets up the starting point or state of the loop. 
                    It's executed once before the loop begins and can also be used to declare the 
                    iterator variable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Condition - This expression determines whether the loop should continue executing.
                    If the condition evaluates as true, then the loop continues; if it evaluates to 
                    false, the loop ends.
                </li>
                <li>
                    an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.
                </li>
            </ol>
