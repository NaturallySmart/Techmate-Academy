    <h4>Introduction to Javascript</h4>
    <h1>Console</h1>

    <p>
        The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. <br>
        Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we  <br>
        want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console directly. <br> <br>

        In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, <br>
        that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language,  <br>
        so the computer recognizes them and treats them specially. <br> <br>

        One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. <br>
        When we write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged,  <br>
        to the console. <br> <br>

        It’s going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so we can see the work  <br>
        that we’re doing.
