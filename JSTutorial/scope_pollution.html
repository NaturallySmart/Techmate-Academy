    <h1>Scope Pollution</h1>

    <p>
        It may seem like a great idea to always make your variables accessible, but having too many 
        global variables can cause problems in a program. <br><br>

        When you declare global variables, they go to the global namespace. The global namespace 
        allows the variables to be accessible from anywhere in the program. These variables remain 
        there until the program finishes which means our global namespace can fill up really 
        quickly and it becomes difficult to keep track of what variable is where. This can lead
        to bugs that are hard to find because we don't know where something came from. <br><br>

        Scope pollution is a problem in JavaScript where variables that are declared inside of 
        functions have the same scope as global variables. This can lead to
        unexpected behavior if not handled properly. <br><br>

        Scope pollution makes it difficult to keep track of our different variables and sets us 
        up for potential accidents. For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other 
        variables that are more locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code.
